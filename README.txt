	The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters in the word.
	By looking to the dashes user can guess the word, then it asks user to enter a letter one by one.
	If the letter suggested by the user occurs in the word, it should write it in all its correct positions.
	If the suggested letter is not correct then, each time guess will be deducted if his choice doesn’t match, it contains total 6 guesses.  it should draw one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
	The game is over-
•	When player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly then player wins the game.
•	When number of tries exceeds a limit then it completes the hangman diagram– Player loses the game.
